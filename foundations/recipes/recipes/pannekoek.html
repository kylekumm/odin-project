    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pannekoek or the South African version of the crêpe are traditionally served with cinnamon sugar, sometimes with a hint of lemon juice. 
        Because these pancakes do not have sugar in the batter, they make a great base 
        for savoury fillings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

     <ul>
        <li>240 grams flour</li>
        <li>600-700 ml milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>30 ml vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>        
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Cinnamon Suagr:
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup brown or caster sugar</li>
                <li>2-3 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>Fresh lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Beat together the eggs, 600 ml of milk and oil until well combined.</li>
        <li>Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl. Slowly add the milk mixture to the flour, whisking to prevent any clumps from forming. OR - place all the ingredients into a blender and blitz together until a thin smooth batter has formed. Allow the pancake mixture to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir through the batter, if it has thickened up, add some more milk until the batter is back to its pouring consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick 30cm frying pan over low to medium heat. Using a ⅓ cup measurer, pour the batter into the centre of the pan, spreading it to the edges. This can be done by picking up the pan and swirling the batter, or by using a plastic or silicon bench scraper lightly over the surface of the pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook on one side until the batter has just become solid, then flip over for another 30 seconds to a minute.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes with a cinnamon-sugar mixture or your favourite filling.</li>
    </ol>
